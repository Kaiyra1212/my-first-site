        <h2>1 Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          The o1 model series is trained with large-scale reinforcement learning to reason using chain of thought. These advanced reasoning capabilities provide new avenues for improving the safety and robustness of our models. In particular, our models can reason about our safety policies in context when responding to potentially unsafe prompts. This leads to state-of-the-art performance on certain benchmarks for risks such as generating illicit advice, choosing stereotyped responses, and succumbing to known jailbreaks.

        <p>
          Training models to incorporate a chain of thought before answering has the potential to unlock substantial benefits, while also increasing potential risks that stem from heightened intelligence. Our results underscore the need for building robust alignment methods, extensively stress-testing their efficacy, and maintaining meticulous risk management protocols. This report outlines the safety work carried out for the OpenAI o1 and OpenAI o1-mini models, including safety evaluations, external red teaming, and Preparedness Framework evaluations.

        <h2>2 Model data and training</h2>
        <p>
          The o1 large language model family is trained with reinforcement learning to perform complex reasoning. o1 thinks before it answers — it can produce a long chain of thought before responding to the user. OpenAI o1 is at its third release in this series (previously OpenAI o1-preview), while OpenAI o1-mini is a fast variant more suitable for tasks that require effective at coding. Through training on massive datasets, careful fine-tuning, and extensive safety evaluations, we aim to push the frontier of aligned, safe, and robust AI models.
